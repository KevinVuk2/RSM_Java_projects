# Project Title: Unit Price and Total Cost Calculator

A simple Java console application designed to compare the value of two packages and calculate the total cost for a potential order. This project was completed for the BMME008 - Programming for Managers course.

# Problem Description
This program helps a consumer make a cost-effective decision between two packages of the same material. It prompts the user to enter the weight (in kg) and price for each package, calculates their respective unit prices, and identifies which package offers a worse value. Finally, it allows the user to select a package and a quantity to order, then calculates and displays the total cost.

# Features
1. User Input: Prompts the user for the weight and price of two packages.
2. Unit Price Calculation: Computes the price per kg for each package.
3. Value Comparison: Determines and displays which package has a higher (worse) unit price.
4. Order Processing: Asks the user which package to order and the desired quantity.
5. Input Validation: Ensures that all user inputs for weight, price, and quantity are positive numbers. If an invalid input is detected, the program informs the user and terminates.
6. Total Cost Calculation: Calculates the final cost based on the user's order.
